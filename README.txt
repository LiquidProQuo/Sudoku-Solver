----------------------------------------

Sudoku Solver v1.0 is a Sudoku puzzle solving application which does exactly what its name implies- solve ANY Sudoku puzzle thrown its way.
Sudoku Solver uses a human-based algorithmn to solve puzzles, ensuring speed and efficiency. 
Currently users may either enter puzzles onto the grid manually or load them in from files. 
Version 1.0 only supports .txt files in the format displayed in the demo puzzles found in the examples folder. However, a blank tile may be
represented by either a "0", a "." or a "*" symbol. Symbols may be used interchangibly. More formats will be available in future versions.
